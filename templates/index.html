        <h3> About Our Camps </p>
        <h6>OUR MISSION</h6>
        <p>Founded by two Cherry Creek High School Computer Science students, 
            our camps aim to foster interest in computer science for middle school students. </p>
        <h6>OUR PROCESS</h6>
        <p>We teach the basics of computer science using the coding languages Processing and Java. 
            We achieve this with a mixture of engaging lessons, notes, games, labs, and worksheets.

        <h6>OUR IMPACT</h6>
        <p>Past students go on to pave the way for computer science in their communities. 
            Many are taking or signed up to take computer science courses at Cherry Creek High School. 
            Others have founded their own programming clubs! Some have contacted us with questions about coding 
            or for extra resources.</p>
